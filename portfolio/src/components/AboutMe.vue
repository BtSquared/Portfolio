    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <div>I’m a software engineer with a background in commercial electrical construction. After a pandemic-related layoff, I decided to learn a new skill that I have always been interested in, coding. Through this I found a hidden talent and passion. In addition to the strong attention to technical details that I developed as an electrician, I also bring leadership skills that I honed as an Eagle Scout before even joining the workforce. And as a full stack software engineer, I love every part of coding that I’ve learned so far, although my true passion lies in the back-end. I someday want to see myself in a back-end role working with large data sets.</div>
